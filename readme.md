# Julia Copula Package

This package implements the gaussian AR1 copula. So far there are only the density and the random methods. 

I just started to learn Julia, so need to figure out how to document properly and what is the right package setup.

ALSO: I kept this very close to the R package copula. Any licensing issues I should keep in mind here?
